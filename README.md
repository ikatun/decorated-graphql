# decorated-graphql
A few node decorators for building GraphQL API.
They allow you to use GraphQL schema as type declarations for your resolvers.

# Requirements
Your project setup must support decorators and the code must be run without class names minimalization.
Here is an example project already setup and ready to run: https://github.com/ikatun/graphql-project.
It's using [nnode](https://github.com/ikatun/nnode) to run any JS code on any node version without transpilation.
